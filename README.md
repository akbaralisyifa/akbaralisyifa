# Halo semua! 

I am Muhammad Akbar Ali Syifa, a recent graduate from Ma'soem University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science specializing in Digital Business. 

As a fresh graduate, I have honed my skills as a Full Stack Developer, proficient in Front-End development using JavaScript, React JS, and Next JS, as well as in Back-End development using Golang. 
Through participation in the MSIB Kampus Merdeka program and a bootcamp at Alterra Academy, I have sharpened my front-end engineering skills and developed high-performance, responsive websites. 
This combination of formal education and practical experience equips me with a deep understanding of the needs and challenges of contemporary digital business.
